## Initialising desired simulation
<br>

When simulating an observation with KSIM all changes can be done within the `SETUP_KSIM/KSIM_INPUT_PARAMETERS.txt` file, which contains all the parameters which can currently be changed (list shown below). <br><br>

## Using KSIM
<br>

KSIM can be run using the `KSIM_V4_0.py` script which will produce plots and a results text file.<br><br>

If the observation parameters are changed beyond the object being 'observed' (such as number of MKIDs) or this is the first run using KSIM, new standard star factors will need to be generated. This can be done by setting `generate_standard_star_factors` to True and simulating the standard star GD71 using the GD71.txt file in `STANDARD_STAR/`. Note the other changes to the parameters file which will be needed such as the correct `folder_dir` input. <br><br>

Once these factors have been generated any other appropriate file can be simulated. If two TLUSTY spectra for a binary simulation in a `.npy` are chosen then this can be entered in the parameters file. Otherwise combine them externally and enter it as a `.txt` file normally in `object_file`.<br><br>
